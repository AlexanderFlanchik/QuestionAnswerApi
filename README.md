# Simple Questions/Answers API

This is a minimal .NET API that provides a simple way to handle questions and answers. It uses JavaScript handlers for processing HTTP requests. The integration with JavaScript is achieved through the use of the **Jint** library, which allows executing JavaScript code directly within the .NET environment.

## Features

- **Minimal API**: Simple .NET 9+ API with minimal boilerplate.
